# 🌍 Carbon Quest  
*Consume with care, the planet we share*  

Carbon Quest is a city-building game that mixes fun with learning. The idea is simple: kids get to be city planners and see how their choices affect the environment.  
By placing things like parks, solar panels, windmills, or factories, they learn how cities can grow while still staying sustainable. .  
 **Two ways to play**  
  - Start with a polluted, badly planned city and try to fix it.  
  - Or begin with an empty canvas and design your own eco-friendly city.  

- **Drag & Drop Building**  
  - Parks, trees, solar panels, windmills, houses, and more.  

- **Live Feedback**  
  - Watch AQI, temperature, and livability change as you play.  

- **Milestones & Challenges**  
  - Reach sustainability goals while managing limited resources.

## 🌱 Why We Built It  

Cities are growing fast, and kids often don’t get engaging ways to learn about the environment. Most sustainability tools are aimed at adults, but tomorrow’s leaders are today’s children.  

Carbon Quest makes learning about climate action **interactive and fun** instead of being a boring classroom lecture.
